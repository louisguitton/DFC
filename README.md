# DFC

The java implementation of "Seed-Guided Topic Model for Document Filtering and Classification ", TOIS 2018.

The model DFC proposed in this paper is an effective topic model for dataless text classification and filtering task.
Feel free to contact me if you find any problem in the package.

## Requirements

- Jre1.7
- Lucene 5.2.1

## Description

### Training/Testing Data Format

Each training sample is a document,which was preprocessed to remove stop words, and each word is separated by space.
Example: training testing data

### Catelog File

Catalog file is uesd to describe category information. The catalog file of data set '20 news groups' sholud be wrote in this form :  
Example:
cate  
comp.graphics  
cate  
sci.med ...

If we want to combine several categories into one , take 'comp' and 'sci' as examples , then the file should be wrote like this :  
Example:  
cate  
comp.graphics  
comp.os.ms-windows.misc  
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware  
comp.windows.x  
comp.sys.mac.hardware
cate  
sci.crypt  
sci.med  
sci.space  
sci.electronics ...

#### Note

The directory “catalog-classification” is for classification task without filtering.The file only contains the categories for classification task.

The directory “catalog-classificationWithFiltering” is for classification with filtering task.The file contains all the categories in dataset.The specifed categories are in the heading, the remaining are irrelevant categories.

Example:
Classification with filtering task: med-space. med and space are specifed categories, others are irrelevant categories.  
cate  
med  
cate  
space  
cate  
sci.crypt  
cate  
sci.electronics ...

## Seed Word File

Each line in seed word file corresponds to a category.Seed word is separated by space.Make sure that the category order in catalog file is the same as the order in seed word file.

LDA File

we take the LDA results after running LDA over 100 iterations, using the default parameter setting(Toolkit:JGibbLDA http://jgibblda.sourceforge.net/)

## Parameter Setting

- method:0:classification, 1:classification with filtering
- relMethod:the method to estimating category word probability, 1:doc-rel, 0:topic-rel
- iCateNum:the total number of specifed categories/relevant-topics,the variable R in paper
- bCateNum:the setting total number of irrelevant-topics,the variable T in paper
- btruth:the total number of irrelevant-topics, which is only used for evaluation and load documents
- cateNum:the setting total number of categories
- ctruth:the total number of categories, which is only used for
- fakeSeedNum:the number of pseudo seed words
- topicNum:the total number of general-topics, the variable B in paper
- LDAtopicnum:the number of LDA hidden topic
- alpha0:the variable alpha0 in paper
- alpha1:the variable alpha1 in paper
- alpha2:the variable alpha1 in paper
- beta0:the variable beta0 in paper
- beta1:the variable beta1 in paper
- rho:the variable rho in paper
- inter:the number of iterations
- report:the method of evaluation, 1:macro F1 , 0:accuracy
- maxDocLen:the max length of documents in the dataset
- kd:the prior likelihood for document d being a relevant document, the variable k_d in paper
- testSetPath:test set path
- trainSetPath:train set path
- catalogPath:category file path
- seedwordPath:seed word file path
- luceneIndexPath:LuceneIndex path
- LDAwordmapPath:LDA word map path
- LDAtassignPath:LDA model path
- LDAphiPath:LDA phi path
- LDAtwordPath:LDA top words path
- resultWriter:output the predict result in file

## launch the program

The main java entry is in class DfcMain.java.To launch the program there are several parameters must be setting as described above.

If you run the task of classification, you need to set the parameters bCateNum and btruth to be zero, then set the catalogPath
